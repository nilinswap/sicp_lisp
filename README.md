1-3 - write largest two without using min
1-4 - if/else over operation? is it function or data?
1-16 and 1-18 teaches to use loop invariant.

1-26 and 1-28 - exponentiation and prime

1-29 - high order functions for integration. in here I was trying to define h as a function but ended up defining a local variable. Soon realised they are same in this context. Moment of Truth(MOT)!!

1-30 - extended 1-29 but then formed another function twoFunEqual which seems like magic now. It is hard to differ a function from data. MOT2

1-32 - accumulator - third order function.
