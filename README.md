# SICP Exercies

Hey, I am just learning [in a bigger scheme of things](https://web.mit.edu/6.001/6.037/sicp.pdf).

1-3 - write largest two without using min
1-4 - if/else over operation? is it function or data?
1-16 and 1-18 teaches to use loop invariant.

1-26 and 1-28 - exponentiation and prime

1-29 - high order functions for integration. in here I was trying to define h as a function but ended up defining a local variable. Soon realised they are same in this context. Moment of Truth(MOT)!!

1-30 - extended 1-29 but then formed another function twoFunEqual which seems like magic now. It is hard to differ a function from data. MOT2

1-32 - accumulator - third order function. 

1-39 - forces to create a speacial lambda which is just a dummy. tan-cf becomes a half implementation of cont-frac. Almost like an interface implementation. 

sqrt - It is real thing to understand this. Like what does it mean to return a procedure. Imagine looking at average-damp or derivative as to when return is a value and when it is a procedure. 

1-41 - A challenge for the understanding. 

1-43 - A recursive order function. Understand how one can make nth order procedures. One idea is to always keep in mind the function signature. A procedure returning a procedure will always return a signature.
